```

3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./desktop-installer.sh
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired desktop environment and set it as the default.
5. Once the installation is complete, the Raspberry Pi will restart and the selected desktop environment will be loaded.

## Features

* User-friendly interface with arrow key navigation and Enter key selection
* Supports a variety of desktop environments
* Automatic repository installation for the selected desktop environment

## Notes

* Some desktop environments may not be as well-tested as others on Raspberry Pi, so you may experience some bugs.
* Please proceed with caution when installing the Deepin desktop environment, as it is not officially maintained for Raspberry Pi.
